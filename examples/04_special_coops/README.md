This example demonstrates using additional parameters that are not hard-coded into the parameter factory.

The section ```JSON
"signaling":{"cic_att":0.2}
```

at the end in `start.par` and the others begins to demonstrate this.

If you include an extra parameter, then it must be included in all the other .par files provided, and the other .par files must be provided (though this is not enforced).
